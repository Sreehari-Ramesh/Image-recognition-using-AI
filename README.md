## Image Recognition for Accessibility
Building AI course Project

## Summary

This is an AI-based solution that empowers visually impaired individuals to access web content by providing accurate and concise textual descriptions of images encountered during web browsing.

## Background

Project addresses the challenge faced by visually impaired individuals when interacting with images online. Visual content is prevalent on the internet, creating a barrier for people with visual impairments. This project uses AI and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and describe images, enhancing web content accessibility.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Limited accessibility for visually impaired users to understand images online.
* The importance of making the internet more inclusive for everyone.

## How is it used?

This is utilized during web browsing when visually impaired users encounter images. The AI analyzes the image content and generates accurate textual descriptions, which are then read aloud using text-to-speech technology. This solution aims to provide a more inclusive internet experience for individuals with visual impairments.

## Challenges

Product does not provide real-time descriptions for rapidly changing images, struggles with complex images, and might miss nuanced details. Ethical considerations include ensuring privacy and avoiding biased descriptions.

## What next?

This project has the potential to grow:
* Integration into web browsers for seamless image recognition.
* Expansion to mobile apps and social media platforms.
* Continuous improvement through user feedback and collaboration.
* Promoting adoption of accessible images and descriptions.

## Acknowledgments

* Inspired by advancements in AI and accessibility technology.
* Implementation based on established frameworks and libraries.
* Contributions of the open-source community and collaboration between AI experts and accessibility advocates.
