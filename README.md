Building AI Project
##Project Name: AccessiVision - Image Recognition for Accessibility


## Summary
This is an idea that uses AI to make people with disabilities use the web content. 



##Background:
AccessiVision aims to address the challenge faced by visually impaired individuals when interacting with images online. Visual content is prevalent on the internet, but for people with visual impairments, understanding these images can be a significant barrier. This project seeks to empower visually impaired users by providing an AI-based solution that can describe images and make web content more accessible.

##Data and AI Techniques:
AccessiVision relies on a diverse dataset of images from various sources, including websites, social media, and online platforms. The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful AI technique for image recognition. The CNN model is trained on labeled images to learn patterns, shapes, and objects within them. The project can also incorporate text-to-speech technology to provide audio descriptions of recognized images.

##How is it Used:
AccessiVision is used in the context of web browsing, where visually impaired users encounter images. When a user encounters an image on a web page, AccessiVision's AI kicks in to analyze the image content and generate an accurate and concise textual description. This description is then read aloud to the user using text-to-speech technology. The solution aims to make the internet a more inclusive space for people with visual impairments.

##Challenges:

AccessiVision does not provide real-time descriptions of images in dynamic environments (e.g., video streams) where images change rapidly.
Complex images with multiple elements may be challenging to describe accurately.
The AI-generated descriptions might not capture nuanced details that a human observer could provide.
What Next:
AccessiVision has the potential to grow in several ways:

Integration into web browsers or browser extensions for seamless image recognition.
Expansion to mobile apps and social media platforms to enhance accessibility across various digital contexts.
Incorporating user feedback to continuously improve the accuracy and quality of image descriptions.
Collaborating with websites and platforms to promote the adoption of accessible images and descriptions.
Acknowledgments:
This project draws inspiration from advancements in AI and accessibility technology. The CNN model implementation is based on established frameworks and libraries. We acknowledge the contributions of the open-source community and the collaboration between AI experts and accessibility advocates.
